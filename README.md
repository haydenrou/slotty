Slotty provides a way of determining available slots within a time frame. An example would be where a service provider needs to take bookings.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'slotty'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install slotty

## Usage

```ruby
Slotty.get_slots(
  for_range: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00)..Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 11, 00),
  slot_length_mins: 60,
  interval_mins: 15,
  exclude_times: [
    Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 00)..Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 10, 00)
  ]
)

# => [
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 00),
#     time: "08:00 AM"
#   },
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 10, 00),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 11, 00),
#     time: "10:00 AM"
#   },
# ]
```

If you want to just receive the human times back (i.e. "10:00 AM"), you can pass `for: :to_s` to `#get_slots`
